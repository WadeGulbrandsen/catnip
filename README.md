#Catnip
One of our cats REALLY likes to chase the mouse cursor on the screen. It can be very hard to use the computer with a
cat in front of the screen so I made this game for her to play, preferably on a screen other than the one I'm using.

## Installation instructions
Copy the contents of public to a web server and then navigate to index.html in a web browser

## Usage
Change the sliders to control the number of birds on the screen and the speed that they move.
To show or hide the options click the button in the bottom right corner.

### Version History

#### Version 0.1.1 - April 6, 2016
Refactoring the code to make the source more readable

#### Version 0.1.0 - April 4, 2016 (initial release)
Game is working.

There are still some things I want to do:
* Multiple backgrounds and a way to select them
* A nice start page with instructions
* Merge the show/hide button and options into a single component
